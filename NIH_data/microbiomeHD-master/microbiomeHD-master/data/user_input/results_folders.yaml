An aliquot (approximately 500 mg) of each sample was then suspended, while frozen, in a solution containing 500 ml of extraction buffer (200 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 200 mM NaCl, 20 mM EDTA), 210 ml of 20% SDS, 500 ml of a mixture of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, pH 7.9), and   500 ml   of   a   slurry   of   0.1-mm   diameter   zirconia/silica   beads   (BioSpec Products). Microbial cells were subsequently lysed by mechanical disruption with a bead beater (BioSpec Products) set on high for 2 min at room temperature, followed by extraction with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol, and precipitation with isopropanol."

    dna_extraction_text: "For   DNA   extraction,   a   0.3 g   stool   aliquot   was   transferred   to a   DNA/RNA-free   sterile   tube,   and   1 ml   of   phosphate-buffered saline was added to the sample. Cell lysis was initiated by adding 50 mL   of   lyzosyme   (10 mg/mL)   and   6 mL   of   mutanolysin (25,000 U/mL;   Sigma-   Aldrich).   After   a1   hour   incubation   at 37uC,   each   sample   was   further   lysed   by   addition   of   10 ml Proteinase   K   and   50 ml   10%   SDS,   followed   by   incubation   at 55uC for 45 minutes. The samples were then disrupted by bead beating, which was performed in a FP120 FastPrep at 6.0 m/s for 40 sec using 0.1 mm silica spheres (QBiogen Lysis Matrix B). The resulting crude lysate was processed using the ZYMO Fecal DNA Kit (Zymogen) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations."
